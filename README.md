# Factory Libraries for use with ZendSkeletonApplication

## Introduction

This is a library of often needed factories that Zend Framework doesn't provide
for the reason they believe it belongs in userland. Meaning that most often users
create and implement the factory or class themselves.

## Installation using Composer

Installing the library using Composer is simple.

```bash
$ composer require jkrasnoo\factories
```
